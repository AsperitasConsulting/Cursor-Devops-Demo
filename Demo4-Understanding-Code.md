# Demo 4:  Understanding code you didn't write

Pull in ```written-by-others/sample1/main.tf into a chat and type in some questions:
```
What does this terraform do?

Are there refactoring opportunities in this code?

Is there any dead code in this terraform configuration? expand scope to include all terraform files in this folder.
```
